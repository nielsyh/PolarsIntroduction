# Data Analysis with Polars and Matplotlib

## Overview
This repository contains assignments that demonstrate data manipulation using the `Polars` library and data visualization with `Matplotlib` in Python. The assignments cover tasks such as loading data, filtering and aggregating data, and creating plots to visualize the results.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `Polars` for fast and efficient data manipulation
- `Matplotlib` for plotting and data visualization

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install polars matplotlib
```

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Data Manipulation with Polars

#### Objective:
In this assignment, you will:
- Load data from a CSV file.
- Perform data manipulation tasks such as selecting specific columns, filtering rows, and adding new columns.
- Group the data by a specific column and perform aggregation operations.
- Save the results to a new CSV file.

#### Steps:
1. Load data from a CSV file into a Polars DataFrame.
2. Select the columns `"Name"`, `"Age"`, and `"City"`.
3. Filter rows where `Age` is greater than 30.
4. Add a new column `Bonus` as 10% of the `"Salary"` column.
5. Group by the `"Department"` column and calculate the average `"Salary"` for each department.
6. Save the grouped data to a new CSV file.

For more details, see [polars_assignment.md](polars_assignment.md).

### Assignment 2: Data Analysis and Plotting with Polars and Matplotlib

#### Objective:
In this assignment, you will:
- Load data from a CSV file.
- Group the data by the `"Age"` column and calculate the average `"Salary"` for each age group.
- Create a plot to visualize the average salary per age group.

#### Steps:
1. Load the data from a CSV file located at `"../dummy_data.csv"`.
2. Group the data by `"Age"` and calculate the average `"Salary"`.
3. Create a plot of `"Age"` vs `"Average Salary"`.

For more details, see [polars_matplotlib_assignment.md](polars_matplotlib_assignment.md).

## Running the Code

After installing the required libraries, you can run the Python scripts in this repository to perform the tasks described in each assignment. Make sure the necessary CSV data is available and adjust file paths accordingly.

```bash
python assignment1.py
python assignment2.py
```
